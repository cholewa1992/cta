\chapter*{Abstract}

Password-based authentication is the most widely used method of authentication, even though research for decades have concluded that it is insecure and user-unfriendly. 
The purpose of this work is to investigate existing research into alternative authentication schemes, and based on a semi-structured review of related work, propose a new design for an authentication scheme, that has a balanced focus on both usability and security aspects. The proposed solution is a continuous and transparent authentication scheme designed to run on consumer-level wearable and mobile technology. The scheme is facilitated by an authentication protocol, that is formally verified and analyzed using a mixed computational and symbolic model approach. To showcase the feasibility of the design, a prototype is implemented using the protocol.
The authentication scheme and protocol proposed in this thesis are designed with the intention of being a complete password replacement, and could realistically be implemented as a mature solution.
