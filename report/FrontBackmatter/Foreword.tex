\chapter*{Forewords and Dedication}


% Our division of labour
\noindent This thesis is a joint work, however, in the later refinement and writing stages of the thesis, Jacob focused on protocol design and verification, while Rasmus focused on analysis, scheme design and implementation.\\

% Introduce our background
\noindent Our academic background is five years of studies in computer science and software development. Our majors are Pervasive Computing and Critical Systems respectively, and so our knowledge of both security and cryptography was very limited before starting this project.

However, our strong background in pervasive and distributed computing systems, and how users interact with such systems, gives rise to this cross disciplinary work that bring a rare user-oriented perspective to an otherwise very security dominated research area.\\

% Thanks to Alessandro
\noindent Last but not least, we wish to thank our supervisor Alessandro Bruni --- Thanks for giving us the opportunity to work with you. Your continued presence, enthusiasm, and many insights have been an invaluable source of knowledge, inspiration and motivation. We could not have wished for a better supervisor.
